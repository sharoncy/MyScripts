# QCScripts
Various Python scripts for generating images for the QC project

The overlay.py script generates circles in a grid pattern on top of a base image, with the circle fill colour representing anchoring accuracy (green = 0 = correctly anchored; yellow = 2 = unknown; red = 1 = incorrectly anchored).
